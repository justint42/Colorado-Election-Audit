# Election_Analysis

## Election Audit Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate total votes casted.
2. Gather a list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate total votes for each relevant candidate.
4. Caclulate vote percentage among relevant candidates.
5. Determine election winner based on popular vote.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to develop the user's acumen in the Python programming language. They will use for loops and conditional statements with membership and logical operators to find the requested election results. Moreover, the user will practice printing results to the command line and saving them to a .txt file. This challenge serves as introductory practice for Python and a general segway to more complicated code in the future.

## Election Audit Summary

Considering our organizational needs, we believe that the Election_Analysis script will be very useful for future county elections and other elections at multiple scales. This code was developed to assist in making the audit process more efficient, providing vote counts at the individual and county levels, their percentages, the election winner, and county with the most votes. Our script may be expanded to accommodate the election results at the state and municipal levels. For example, the “county”-related variables of this script may be substituted for “district”-related variables. In elections where votes are divided amongst congressional districts, we may modify our print() outputs such as “Largest District Turnout: 7th District”. This script may also be used to audit Colorado primary elections for each political party.

 Thank you for considering this script for the recent Colorado congressional election. I will be here to provide more detailed explanation on future script implementations and to offer support and answer questions as needed.
